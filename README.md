# SVM Algorithm on Adult Income Dataset

This project uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict an individual's income from the **Adult Income Dataset**. The goal is to determine whether an individual earns more or less than 50k per year based on various demographic and job-related features.

# Dataset Structure

## The Adult Income Dataset contains the following columns:

age: The age of the individual.

workclass: Type of work (e.g., private, public).

fnlwgt: Weight of the individual in the dataset.

education: Education level of the individual.

education-num: Number of years of education.

marital-status: Marital status.

occupation: Occupation of the individual.

relationship: Relationship to the reference person.

race: Race of the individual.

sex: Gender of the individual.

capital-gain: Capital gains.

capital-loss: Capital losses.

hours-per-week: Hours worked per week.

native-country: Country of origin.

income: Target variable to predict (>50k or <=50k).

## Performance
The model will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.

Recall: The ability to correctly identify individuals earning more than 50k USD.
